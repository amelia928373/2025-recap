# Notes:
# - This workflow will publish the repository root to the gh-pages branch when you push to main.
# - If your project has a build step, update `publish_dir` to the build output (e.g. ./build or ./dist)
# - Make sure Actions has "Read and write" workflow permissions so the GITHUB_TOKEN can push the gh-pages branch.
